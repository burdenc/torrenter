Docker-compose file for bringing up PIA with wireguard and piping all transmission traffic through said VPN. There's also a helper script for setting the forwarded port in transmission.

See TODOs for values that need to be set by the user.

99% of the credit goes to the wireguard docker image maintainers: https://hub.docker.com/r/thrnz/docker-wireguard-pia
